# VMWare Fusion Scripts #

About
--------
The scripts are designed to work with VMWare Fusion

License: [GNU General Public License v3][1]

Additional Information
---------

Currently there is a single set of scripts dedicated to suspending and starting virtual machines. One of the scripts available will suspend all running virtual machines on the system, execute a script of your choice and then resume all the virtual machines which were initially suspended.

# below is an example you can use to run this script and to execute the example rsync backup script - note you will need to create some folders and edit the example backup script.
$ cd /Volumes/vmware-volume/virtual_machines/bin/suspend_and_resume/ && ../copy_vms_to_backup_directory.bash

If you have any handy VMWare fusion scripts, then fork the project add your scripts and then put in a pull request. 

Any questions, then just let me know.

Pick and chose the ones which are handy for you =:^)
